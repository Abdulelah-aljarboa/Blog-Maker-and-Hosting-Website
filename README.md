# Blog Maker and Hosting Website
in this Project, we built our first complete website for the course CS346
which covers the front-end and the back-end

the website is a place where users can signup and start making their own blogs using 
Markdown markup language (just like what GitHub uses for the README.md file)

users can view other blogs and theirs and also edit them or delete them if they want
